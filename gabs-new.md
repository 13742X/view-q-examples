# Gifts & Benefits Policy

1. Purpose
This policy, based on the 2010 Anti Bribery & Corruption Act 2010 (UK) sets out the procedure staff must follow when giving or receiving gifts, benefits and hospitality ("GaBs").

2. Scope
This policy applies to full time and part time employees on a substantive or fixed-term contract, and to associated persons such as secondees, agency staff contractors and others employed under a contract of service to the firm and its group companies resident in the UK. Overseas companies will have their own policy.

## The Policy

1. Policy Statement

You must declare all offers of GaBs, made to or by you, where the approximate or actual value exceeds the policy value.

All such GaBs must be declared whether accepted or declined. Offers of gifts and hospitality may include items ranging from diaries, wall charts, and boxes of chocolates, to free international travel and accommodation. Declarations must be recorded on the register at https://systemm.co/registerse/6/1. The register is maintained by the Board and is publicly available through SystemM. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are not placed in a position that risks, or appears to risk, compromising your role or the firm's public and statutory duties. You should not be seen to be securing valuable gifts and hospitality by virtue of your job. You should not accept or provide any gift or hospitality if acceptance/provision will give the impression that you have been influenced/are deemed to be influencing while acting in an “official capacity”. This Policy also applies to spouses, partners or other associates if it can be argued or perceived that the gift or hospitality is in fact for the benefit of the official. In exercising judgement as to whether to accept a gift or hospitality the question should be asked what public perception would be if the information was published given your role and circumstances.

2. Policy Value
You may retain, and not need record on the register, all gifts valued at £500.00 or under, in any one situation. For GaBs exceeding a value of £500.00, the register must be updated for review to ensure no conflict of interest or decision making bias.  If possible, the following options are also suggested:  share the gift with all staff;  raffle the gift for charity;  donate the gift to charity; or  make a donation to charity and keep the gift.

3. Accepting offers of hospitality – genuine business reasons
Hospitality offered should only be accepted where there is a direct link to working arrangements and a genuine business reason can be demonstrated, for example:  attendance or speaking at a conference, which provides complimentary subsistence, travel and accommodation (this does not need to be declared on the register except where a gift was received, see paragraph 4);  attending at a free training course; or  attending a drinks reception to network. It is recognised that, in the course of carrying out your duties, you will need on occasion to ensure good relationships with existing and future contractors and stakeholders and that this may involve for example, the receipt of modest working lunches and dinners. These are acceptable where there is a genuine business reason. Hospitality invitations to events which are purely social events should be considered very carefully before accepting; in such circumstances it may be much more difficult to substantiate a genuine business reason. You are expected to use annual leave for such events. You may not accept free holidays from a current or potential contractor. These invitations should be recorded in the register whether received or declined. If in doubt seek permission from the Management Committee.

4. Declaration
You should make your declaration as soon as possible after the offer or receipt of GaBs. All declarations will be recorded in the register. The register is an annual document and will be reviewed by the Management Committee.
