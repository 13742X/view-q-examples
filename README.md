# view-q-examples
Sample files for import or paste into view-q.

View-q requires a pair of files - a menu.csv and a markdown.md.

For convenience the package name is used for each pair - example is test.md and text.csv.

Github implements CORs and to serve these files, use a service like jsdelivr.com
