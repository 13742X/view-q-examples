## Examples (version 0.0.3.0)

There are a number of ways to view documents. 

Certain data storage (e.g cloud or CDN) services can serve non CORS markdown files. We have found Google Workspace, GitHub, Cloudinary, Pandadoc, Box and Dropbox can be used (let us know of others!).

Here are some clickable link examples showing various way to read files stored externally.

After the link has been clicked the extension of website version will display in Settings the 2 files used. The service providers may change at any time (CORs or depreciating services) so if the link does not work, it may be because of this. For example the Dropbox example is unsupported (but works).

## Try These

## Examples

The app comes with the Help documentation and the file location is within the app (HELP.MD).

To view other examples:

### Read Me (stored on Github)

    Markdown File : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/13742x/view-q@latest/README.MD 

    Menu File: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/13742x/view-q@latest/README.CSV

    The above uses a Polish based third party to serve the files and the privacy and security issues should be considered. It is understood all serves are cached permanently and the @latest for only 7 days.
    
    This fetches the raw files from Github (example is the New Testament).
