## Examples

The app comes with the Help documentation and the file location is within the app (HELP.MD).

To view other examples:

### Read Me (stored on Github)

    Menu File: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/13742x/view-q@latest/README.CSV

    The above uses a Polish based third party to serve the files and the privacy and security issues should be considered. It is understood all serves are cached permanently and the @latest for only 7 days.
    
    This fetches the raw files from Github (example is the New Testament).

{{Datastores}}
There are a number of ways to store documents for viewing. 

Certain data storage (e.g clouds or CDN) services can serve files. We have found Office 365, Google Workspace, GitHub, Cloudinary, Pandadoc, Box and Dropbox can be used (let us know of others!).

Here are some clickable link examples showing various way to read files stored externally.

After the link has been clicked the extension of website version will display in Settings the 2 files used. The service providers may change at any time (such as adding CORs restriction or depreciating services) so if the link does not work, it may be because of this. For example, our Dropbox example is unsupported (but works).
